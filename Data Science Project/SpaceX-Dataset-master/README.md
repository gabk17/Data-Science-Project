### Project Summary

### First Dataset - 

#### Content:

This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.

#### Acknowledgements:

The data was scraped from the SpaceX and NASA website.

#### Inspiration:

Has the rate of SpaceX rocket launches increased in the past decade? How many missions do you predict will be launched in 2018?

### Second Dataset - 

#### Content:

The dataset contains mission information for rocket launches conducted by SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp).

#### Acknowledgements:

Data were obtained via Wikipedia's entry for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

#### Inspiration:

Do you anticipate an increase in launches with the introduction of the Falcon Heavy? How has launch rate increased over time? Do you predict a shift in payload orbits for upcoming launches? How has the customer diversity changed over the years?
